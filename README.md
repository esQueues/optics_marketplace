How built: for manupilating with database i used PgAdmin 4. 'Skeleton' pattern helped to me use efficiency JDBC connection. 
           Used about 200 object in database. S.O.L.I.D. principles also helped a lot to built a good system. 
           Also, used the capabilities of OOP: classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.
